# Data source

The data we are working with was gathered from the following two websites about beer lovers:

- [RateBeer](https://www.ratebeer.com/)
- [BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/)

#### From each website we used several datasets:

- **users** (_American and European users only!_)
- **ratings** (_`user_id`, `date`, `abv`, `rating`, `appearance`, `aroma`, `palate`, `taste`, `overall`_)
- **styles_matching** (_Generalising the `specific` beer style to its `general` style_)
- **beers** (_`style` and `abv`_)
