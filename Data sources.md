# Data Source

---

The data we are working with was gathered from the following two websites about beer lovers:

- [RateBeer](https://www.ratebeer.com/)
- [BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/)

### From each website, we used several datasets:

- **Users** (_American and European users only!_)
- **Ratings** (_`user_id`, `date`, `abv`, `rating`_)
- **Styles Matching** (_Generalizing the `specific` beer style to its `general` style_)
- **Beers** (_`style` and `abv`_)
