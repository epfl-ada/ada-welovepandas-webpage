# Evolution over time
Diving deeper and deeper into this data, made us question if the tendency for beers with higher ABV has increased over time. 

Do Amricans or Europeans like beers with more alcohol as time goes by?

Let's take a look at this plot:

![Avg_ABV](./plots/abv_time.png) 
_It looks like it is true! There is a slight evolution of the ABV over time!_
</br>_The graph clearly shows that gerenally North American consumers drink stronger beers on average than European._

That's not all! We discovered another very interesting thing!
</br>Look at the shape of the trendline! It is periodical!

This gives an insight for the seasonality of this magical drink. Even though it is more noticable for North Americans, ABV has peaks every start of a new year and a low peak each summer, on both continents. But why is the shape of the trendline different for Europeans? Why is it not that clear, as the one for North Americans?

`Note 1: The fluctuations present in the first few years are not relevant for observation. It is possible that the reason behind this noise is the very few users of both BeerAdvocate and RateBeer at the begining of their existance. As the popularity of this websites grew, and more users started to register, the curve started to take its representative shape.`
