# Conclusion

In conclusion, our study reflects on the relationship between beer styles and ABV (Alcohol by Volume) preferences, revealing how these tastes have developed over time in both America and Europe. It's fascinating to see how cultural and seasonal factors can shape our choices in beer, with North Americans showing a preference for higher ABV beers during the winter, and Europeans showing varied tastes with spikes during Oktoberfest and in May.

From 2000 to 2017, we've observed a notable trend in both regions: a steady increase in the popularity of higher ABV beers. This shift could be a reflection of evolving tastes, a growing interest in craft beers known for their varied and higher ABV, or perhaps changes in social drinking patterns.

Our analysis provides a detailed snapshot of how beer preferences have uniquely evolved in each region over these seventeen years, underscoring the idea that beer preferences are deeply rooted in regional cultural nuances.

This analysis offers a comprehensive look into the dynamics of the beverage market and consumer behavior, highlighting the evolving relationship between beer styles, ABV, and regional preferences. For further research, we can explore the factors driving these trends, the role of craft beers in these changes, and how these preferences might continue to evolve.

And after all the analysis and statistics we can finish our project with CHEERS!
