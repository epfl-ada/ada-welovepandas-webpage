# Beer styles

---

There are many specific beer styles, which have different alcohol content!

Let's group them by general style and explore the ABV and users' preference correlation!

![ABV by beer style](./plots/style_abv.png)
_We see that some beer styles are significantly stronger than others. If these styles are consumed more frequently on one of the two continents compared to the other, then this could explain some differences in the way ratings are correlated with ABV._

_Americans are dominating Europeans in the number of ratings per beer style... but..._

![Rating by beer style](./plots/style_rating.png)
_nevertheless, the average rating per beer style between the two groups is comparable. American ratings are always higher, except when it comes to Porters! It looks like Europeans like this beer as much as Americans do!_

## Conclusion

Americans are huge fans of beer styles with high alcohol content (above 6%), such as **Stouts, Strong Ales, India Pale Ale, Porters, Bocks** and **Dark Ales**. We can see this from the number of ratings, as well as the high rating average. **Strong Ales, Stouts** and **India Pale Ale** have an average rating greater than 3.5 and the number of ratings for these beer styles is double, or even 4-5 times grater than the number of ratings Europeans submitted.
