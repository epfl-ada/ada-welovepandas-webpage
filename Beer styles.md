# Beer Styles

---

There are many specific beer styles, each with different alcohol content!

Let's group them by general style and explore the correlation between ABV and users' preferences.

## Conclusion

Americans are huge fans of beer styles with high alcohol content (above 6%), such as **Stouts, Strong Ales, India Pale Ale, Porters, Bocks,** and **Dark Ales**. This is evident from the number of ratings, as well as the high average rating. **Strong Ales, Stouts,** and **India Pale Ale** have an average rating greater than 3.5, and the number of ratings for these beer styles is double, or even 4-5 times greater than the number of ratings Europeans submitted.
