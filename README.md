# Beers Across the Atlantic
## Initiative
**Beer** :beer::
the Worldâ€™s Most Beloved Drink

It is accepted worldwide that **beer** is the "most beloved drink", but who is leading the competition? 
</br>We would say Europe and America are the biggest beer consumers among all continents.

But again, do Americans and Europeans drink the same beer types, or is there a beer attribute that makes a difference between this two big consumer groups?
#### Let's investigate the beer preferences accross the Atlantic!

## Description
Using a larga dataset, which provides beer ratings and reviews on beers from people all around the world, we will investigate the difference in beer preferences accross Americans and Europeans, and try to find the reason behind it! Embracing the 14 beer general styles provided, which differ in characteristics as ABV, appearance, aroma, palate and taste, we expect to find interesting results. 

We suspect that cultural dissimilarities among this two groups might lead to different inclinations when it comes to alcohol concentration in beers. Moreover, we will inspect the correlation of beer type with this inclination and we will deep into the evolution of the beer preferences between 2000 and 2017, hoping to find some difference among America and Europe.
